1. Setting Up Dependencies and Server:

express: Imports the Express framework for creating a basic web server.
fs: Imports the file system module for interacting with files and directories.
path: Imports the path module for manipulating file and directory paths.
Server Creation: Creates an Express app instance (app) and sets the port number (PORT) for listening to incoming requests.

2. Creating Output Directory (outputFolder):

Checks if the directory ./output exists using fs.existsSync.
If not, creates the directory using fs.mkdirSync. This step ensures a dedicated location to store the created files.

3. Routes for File Operations:

a. / (GET):

Responds to GET requests on the root path with a simple message "Hello from the server!".

b. /createFile (POST):

Handles POST requests for creating a new file.
Generates a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.txt. This approach incorporates timestamps directly into the file names, making them easily identifiable.

Here's the timestamp extraction:

The current date and time are obtained using new Date().
Individual components like year (year), month (month), date (date), hours (hrs), minutes (mins), and seconds (secs) are extracted.
Each component is padded with leading zeros (padStart(2, '0')) for consistent two-digit representation.
The timestamp string is constructed using string interpolation.
Constructs the file path by joining the outputFolder and the generated timestamp filename using path.join.
Writes the current date and time in ISO 8601 format (currentTime.toISOString()) to the file using fs.writeFile.
Handles potential errors (err) by sending a 500 status code and an error message.
Responds with a success message on successful file creation, including the created file's path (filePath).

c. /getFiles (GET):

Handles GET requests for retrieving a list of text files in the outputFolder.
Reads the directory contents using fs.readdir.
Filters the retrieved files (files) to include only those with the .txt extension using filter. This ensures you get only text files.
Sends the filtered list of text files (textFiles) as a JSON response.

Key Points on File System Timestamps:

This code demonstrates generating timestamps for file names, providing a way to track file creation times.
It doesn't directly modify existing timestamps on the file system.
By including timestamps in file names, you gain the ability to identify files chronologically based on their creation.
